I"Ô<p>Having finished the bootcamp and while looking for a new junior web dev job, Iâ€™m
keeping myself busy with code challenges and a pet project.</p>

<p><img class="pull-left" src="/images/heroku-meme-asset-pipeline.jpg" alt="Heroku meme" style="width: 170px;" /></p>

<p>I recently came across an issue when I added an image in my stylesheet (scss).</p>

<p>I added a background-image with a relative path, indicating a file in my
/app/assets/images directory.</p>
