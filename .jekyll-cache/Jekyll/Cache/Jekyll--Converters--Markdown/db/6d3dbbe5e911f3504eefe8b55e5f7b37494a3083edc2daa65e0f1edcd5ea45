I"!<p>If there’s something I wanted while growing up, it was adopting a cat!</p>

<p>My cousin new this and she has a friend with kittens to give away, so she thought of me!
And so in July I became a cat mom 🤩 🥳</p>

<p>Meet Poki, the cutest cat on the block.
He is now almost 3 months old.</p>

<p>I’ve never held such a young and cute kitten before and he’s absolutely adorable 😍</p>

<p>The opportunity came about in May, when he was born. It took me some time get my boyfriend on board but he eventually agreed.</p>

<p>Now I catch him looking at Poki and melting away… Just like me 😄</p>

<p>Poki stayed with his mom and brothers until he was 1.5 months so that he would develop properly.</p>

<p>During this time, I’ve been preparing the apartment to accommodate Poki in the best possible way.</p>

<p>He is very friendly and is always playing with us, which is really surprising because I always thought that cats were very independent and would come to their humans just for food!</p>

<p>Well, I think he doesn’t just want food from us, I think he loves us back 😂😍</p>
