I"?<p>Having finished the bootcamp and while looking for a new junior web dev job, Iâ€™m
keeping myself busy with code challenges and a pet project.</p>

<p><img class="pull-left" src="/images/heroku-meme-asset-pipeline.jpg" alt="Heroku meme" style="width: 170px;" /></p>

<p>I recently came across an issue when I added an image in my stylesheet (scss) as
a background-image from a relative path, indicating a file in my
/app/assets/images directory.</p>

<p>The below ðŸ‘‡ worked out fine on my localhost:</p>

<p><br /></p>

<div class="language-css highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nt">background-image</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nt">url</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s1">"footer-callout.jpg"</span><span class="o">);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><br /></p>

<p>This was until I deployed and then my image disappeared. It took me some time
to figure out how to get the image to display in Heroku. For an image located in
/app/assets/images/footer-callout.jpg, assuming that it is a CSS background
image, you want to reference it as</p>

<p><br /></p>

<div class="language-css highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nt">background</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nt">url</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="nt">image-path</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s1">"footer-callout.jpg"</span><span class="o">));</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><br /></p>

<p>I looked up <a href="https://guides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html#css-and-sass">Rails guides</a>
for answers and what I found on section 2.3.2 was not clear</p>

<p>I recently also heard from a friend and fellow Le Wagon alumni that we should
replace any images with the <code class="highlighter-rouge">.jpeg</code> extension with <code class="highlighter-rouge">.jpg</code> as Heroku
wonâ€™t display the former.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>What can I take from this? Deploying to Heroku can be tricky, so do it as often
as possible. This way, any issues will be sorted more easily.</p>
