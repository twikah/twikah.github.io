I"»<p>Iâ€™ve been trying to learn web development on my own for a while now.</p>

<p>The online tutorials helped me doing my personal website and MLSâ€™ website but
still Rails is a lot of magic and Iâ€™m constantly confused and donâ€™t know how to
tackle new features that I want to implement.</p>

<p><img class="pull-left" src="/images/bootcamp-1.jpg" alt="a computer on a table" style="height: 160px;" /></p>

<p>I need to understand Ruby more in depth to feel more confident about my work.
So I went looking for web development bootcamps in Lisbon. I found Ironhack,
Le Wagon and Academia de CÃ³digo. I searched their syllabus, their length and
their cost.</p>

<p>All these bootcamps have good reputation and good reviews from students.</p>

<p>Le Wagon offered, in my opinion, the most complete curriculum and was aligned
with my interesr in learning Ruby. The cost and the length of the bootcamp were
also appealing. Le Wagon was the chosen one</p>
