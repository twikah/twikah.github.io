I",<p>I’ve been trying to learn web development on my own for a while now.</p>

<p>The online tutorials helped me doing my personal website and MLS’ website but
still Rails is a lot of magic and I’m constantly confused and don’t know how to
tackle new features that I want to implement.</p>

<p><img class="pull-left" src="/images/bootcamp-1.jpg" alt="a computer on a table" style="width: 160px;" /></p>

<p>I need to understand Ruby in depth to feel more confident about my work.
So I went looking for web development bootcamps in Lisbon. I found Ironhack,
Le Wagon and Academia de Código. I searched their syllabus, their length and
their cost.</p>

<p>All these bootcamps have good reputation and good reviews from students.</p>

<p>Le Wagon offered, in my opinion, the most complete curriculum and was aligned
with my interest in learning Ruby. The cost and the length of the bootcamp were
also appealing. <a href="https://www.lewagon.com/">Le Wagon</a> was the chosen one!</p>

<p>I am now doing the prep work and will start on Jan 13th. Wish me luck!</p>
