I"³<p>Two years after leaving to travel around the world, weâ€™re back to Lisbon.
No, not just visiting. We rented this new apartment with a 2-year contract, soâ€¦ Here to stay!</p>

<p>It feels good to be back home but it wasnâ€™t what I wanted to do. I wanted to take advantage of my remote job and keep travelling for one more year. But my partner in crime wanted to stay and so I stayed.

<p>Looking on the bright side, Iâ€™ll finally have my books around me again ğŸ¤“ And also my coats!</p>

<p>Iâ€™m sure this will be a great adventure. Maybe Iâ€™ll adopt a cat! ğŸˆ ğŸˆ ğŸˆ</p>
