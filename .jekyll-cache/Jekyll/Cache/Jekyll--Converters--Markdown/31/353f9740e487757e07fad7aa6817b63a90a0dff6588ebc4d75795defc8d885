I"ú<p>This is a how-to guide on how to implement the OutSystemsâ€™ built-in Date Picker
widget and override some undesired behaviour on the way.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m working on a project where, a while ago, I needed to identify all the
existing Input widgets that had the data type set to â€œDateâ€ to replace them with
the OutSystemsâ€™ built-in Date Picker widget.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Once I started implementing the new Date Picker widget, I faced some challenges:</p>

<p>Â Â Â Â  1. I wanted to set the <strong>date format</strong> as â€œDD/MM/YYYYâ€
but the dates would show as â€œYYYY-MM-DDâ€;</p>

<p>Â Â Â Â  2. The Date Picker is bound to an Input widget which
shows the selected date. The Input widget <strong>allowed the user to write on it</strong>,
whether it already had a date selected or not;</p>

<p>Â Â Â Â  3. The Input widget mentioned above (which is inside a
form) was <strong>not</strong> set to mandatory - meaning that I should be able to save a
record without setting the date on it. From here, 3 scenarios emerged:</p>

<p>Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  3.1. I didnâ€™t select any date on
the Date Picker and everything went well.</p>

<p>Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  3.2. I selected a date on the
Date Picker and then I hit delete to remove that date. Then, I saved the record
and <strong>the date that I tried to delete was still persisted on the database</strong>.</p>

<p>Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  3.3. Instead of directly hitting
the delete key to remove the date, I selected the date with my mouse and hit
delete afterwards. Then, I saved the record and this time I was able to save the
record with a null date.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>I created a little video demonstrating the odd behaviour outlined in point 3
above.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>I searched the OutSystems documentation, the forums and the OutSystems UI Style
Guide for solutions. This post acts as a <em>how-to guide</em> to set the Date Picker
to behave in the best possible way.</p>

<p>The guide will be lengthy so Iâ€™ll split it into 2 parts. Part 1 details how I
set up the widget and sorted the date format issue. Part 2 will show what I did
to overcome points 2 and 3 from the list above.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ll be using a Reactive app to illustrate each step. The user story is <strong>I want
my users to be able to book a vacation period</strong>. The following screenshots are
from the screen <em>VacationCreation</em>, where thereâ€™s a form to accomplish my goal.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Hereâ€™s what I did:</p>

<p>Â Â Â Â  1. I created a local variable for each Date Picker on
the screen. In my <em>VacationPlanner</em> app, I needed a <strong>Start Date input</strong> and
<strong>End Date input</strong> to book my vacations. I named these local variables
<em>PickedBookingStartDate</em> and <em>PickedBookingEndDate</em>. Both have the data type
â€œTextâ€;</p>

<p><br /></p>
<div class="center-img">
  <img class="img-medium" src="/images/os_datepicker-1.png" alt="Setting up local variables" />
</div>
<p><br /></p>

<p>Â Â Â Â  2. I set the variable property of the Inputs (to which
the Date Pickers are bound) to the local variables created above. I changed
their data type to â€œTextâ€ as well;</p>

<p><br /></p>
<div class="center-img">
  <img src="/images/os_datepicker-2.png" alt="Assigning the local variable PickedBookingStartDate to the Inputâ€™s variable property" />
</div>
<p><br /></p>

<p>Â Â Â Â  3. If the user is editing an existing vacation booking,
I want to display any dates previously saved. For that, I needed to assign the
variables created on step 1 to any existing date on my booking. I selected the
aggregate <em>GetBookingbyId</em>â€Š-â€Šwhich is used to record and populate the fields
on my screenâ€Š-â€Šand added a <strong>new action to its On After Fetch event</strong>;</p>

<p><br /></p>
<div class="center-img">
  <img class="img-medium" src="/images/os_datepicker-3.png" alt="Adding an action to the GetBookingByIdâ€™s On After Fetch event" />
</div>
<p><br /></p>

<p>Â Â Â Â  4. On my action <em>GetBookingByIdOnAfterFetch</em>, I
assigned the dates from the database to their corresponding local variables
from step 1. Here, I checked if the saved dates were null dates and, if not, I
converted them into text;</p>

<p><br /></p>
<div class="center-img">
  <img class="img-large" src="/images/os_datepicker-4.png" alt="Getting any existing DB values with On After Fetch action" />
</div>
<p><br /></p>

<p>Â Â Â Â  5. I added the desired <strong>date format</strong> to the Date
Pickerâ€™s DateFormat property;</p>

<p><br /></p>
<div class="center-img">
  <img src="/images/os_datepicker-5.png" alt="Setting the Date Pickerâ€™s date format" />
</div>
<p><br /></p>

<p>Â Â Â Â  6. I set the OnSelect handler of the Date Pickers to
their corresponding actions. Each picker has its own handler actionâ€Š-â€Š
<em>OnSelectDate_StartDate</em> and <em>OnSelectDate_EndDate</em>;</p>

<p><br /></p>
<div class="center-img">
  <img class="img-large" src="/images/os_datepicker-6.png" alt="Setting the Date Pickerâ€™s OnSelect handlers" />
</div>
<p><br /></p>

<p>Â Â Â Â  7. To be able to save the new selected dates, I added
the following assign on my <em>CreateEditBooking</em> action:</p>

<p><br /></p>
<div class="center-img">
  <img class="img-large" src="/images/os_datepicker-7.png" alt="Saving the Date Pickerâ€™s dates" />
</div>
<p><br /></p>

<p>And thatâ€™s how I sorted the issue with the date format.</p>
