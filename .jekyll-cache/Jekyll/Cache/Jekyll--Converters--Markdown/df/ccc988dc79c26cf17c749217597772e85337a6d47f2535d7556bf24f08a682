I"2<p>Two weeks ago I finished the 9-week web development bootcamp at Le Wagon Lisbon.</p>

<p>What a journey! It’s impressive how much you can learn in 9 weeks. We started
out with programming basics such as data types - <strong>always think of the data
type that an operation will return</strong>!</p>

<p>Then, we approached flow control and more advanced concepts of OOP, like classes
and inheritance.</p>

<p>From there, we learned about databases, schema design and SQL. We touched
front end with a week of HTML, CSS and Javascript ES6 (I loved learning more
about AJAX).</p>

<p>The last part of the program involved Rails and useful tools to help building
robust web apps in teams.</p>

<p>I had a little bit of experience with Rails before the bootcamp. I was able to
put pieces of code together and make it work, but many times I didn’t understand
what the code was doing. These 9 weeks helped have a much clearer picture of
what’s happening there.</p>

<p>After all the
intensive coding, sweat and tears, I’m now searching for a junior developer job
in Lisbon. If you know tech recruiters who work in Lisbon please tag their names
in this message or share my post with them.</p>

<p>I learned Rails by doing a website and a back-office for my previous employer
and over the past 9 weeks I’ve built two projects in a team of 4 people,
working with Ruby, Rails, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, SQL, Git, Github and Heroku.</p>

<p>I couldn’t be happier for the amazing community that I met. The team at Le Wagon
Lisbon is incredible and their support made everything easier, so a big thanks
to all of the teachers, assistants and fellow students!</p>
