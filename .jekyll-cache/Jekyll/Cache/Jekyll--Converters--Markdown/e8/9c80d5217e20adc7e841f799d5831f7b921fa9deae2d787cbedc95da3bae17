I"¨<p><a href="https://www.outsystems.com/platform/">OutSystems</a> is a low code platform that
gives IT professionals and developers tools to build, deploy and manage mobile
and web apps in a fast and efficient manner.</p>

<p>All the core development happens on Service Studio, the main OutSystems IDE,
using domain-specific visual language. It provides cool functionalities like
full-stack visual development &amp; single-click deployment. It can be deployed
either on Cloud or on-premise. The system can be integrated with almost all
popular platforms.</p>

<p>I had heard a lot of interesting things about OutSystems in the past and was
curious about it so, last April, I started studying to get a certification to
become an OutSystems Associate Web Developer.</p>
