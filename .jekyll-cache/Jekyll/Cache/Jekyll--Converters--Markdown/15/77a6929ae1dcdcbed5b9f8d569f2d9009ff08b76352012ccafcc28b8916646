I"¦<p>After developing MLS website I was asked to take my coding adventure one step
further. I was tasked with creating a booking platform to support the company
business.</p>

<p>What a great responsability!</p>

<p>I took some time to think very carefully of a data model that would suit the
companyâ€™s needs and automate the procedures that were the most time consuming
for recruiters and for managers.</p>

<p>To know the details please check out the project page
<a href="https://vanessaesanto.com/projects/3-booking">here</a>.</p>

<p>It took me 5 months to get the first version of the booking platform out but I
did it! Itâ€™s just so awesome when your code works :)</p>
