I"Ô<p>Here is an excerpt from <a href="https://zapier.com/blog/daily-routines/?utm_campaign=The%20Morning%20and%20Evening%20Routines%20That%20Will%20Set%20Up%20Each%20Day%20for%20Success&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=blogblogposts">this</a> Zapier article. I find it curious that I never took the time to think about the differences between these words.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Habits vs. Routines vs. Rituals:</em> Wondering what the difference is between habits, routines, and rituals? <strong>Habits</strong> are things that we do automatically â€“ things like checking your email first thing in the morning or putting your keys in a specific spot when you get home. <strong>Routines</strong> are usually a collection of habits or actions you do on a regular basis to bring order to your dayâ€“checking your email, then writing your dayâ€™s to-do list, then checking your teamâ€™s project management tool as a way of getting the day started. <strong>Rituals</strong> are like routines. The main difference is <a href="http://www.theemotionmachine.com/routines-vs-rituals/">the attitude behind the actions</a>: taking a walk everyday at lunch could be considered a routine if you think of it as something you need to do for your productivity. Or it could be a ritual if you think of it as a way to break out of the mundane and enjoy nature. While weâ€™re focusing on habits and routines here, most routines could be turned into rituals with a change of perspective.</p>
