Well, Hello World!</p>

<p>My name is Vanessa, I’m currently changing my life in some considerable ways:</p>

<p><i class="far fa-hand-point-right"></i> I left my job because I couldn’t keep up
with the place’s culture;</p>

<p><i class="far fa-hand-point-right"></i> As a result of that I applied for a
1-year VISA to Australia and it’s granted, so I’ll live abroad for the first
time in my life;</p>

<p><i class="far fa-hand-point-right"></i> I’m learning how to become a tech girl
because I want to work remotely in the future and my opinion is that it will be
easier if I’m familiar with programming and stuff;</p>

<p><i class="far fa-hand-point-right"></i> I’m considering minimalism as a
lifestyle to pursue.</p>

<p>So, while I wait unemployed to travel to Melbourne, I’m using my time to improve
my tech skills. I tried to build a WordPress theme as a way of starting my
portfolio but I realised that I don’t know enough HTML, PHP, CSS and JS to get
it done. Then, I decided to make my own website first, as an easier way of also
starting my portfolio.</p>

<p>Right now, I’m considering developing my site in Ruby on Rails because I
stumbled on railsgirls.com. The purpose of this blog is to log my journey and
hopefully register my progress. It is also for getting people to know me,
of course :)</p>

<p>Today I’m leaving this piece of inspiration here, so I won’t forget that all I
need.. <a href="https://signalvnoise.com/posts/2538-the-first-step-is-to-start">is to start</a> !</p>
