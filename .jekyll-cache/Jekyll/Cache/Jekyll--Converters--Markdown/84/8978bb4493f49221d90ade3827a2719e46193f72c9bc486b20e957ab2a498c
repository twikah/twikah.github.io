I"x<p>I’ve been trying to learn web development on my own for a while now.</p>

<p>I’ve done some online tutorials and was able to do some my portfolio and MLS
website but still Rails is a lot of magic and I’m constantly confused and don’t know how to tackle new features that I want to implement.</p>

<p>It feels good to be back home but it wasn’t what I wanted to do. I wanted to take advantage of my remote job and keep travelling for one more year. But my partner in crime wanted to stay and so I stayed.</p>

<p><img class="pull-left" src="/images/home.jpg" alt="a bird's cage on a wall" style="height: 160px;" /></p>

<p>Looking on the bright side, I’ll finally have my books around me again 🤓</p>

<p>Of course, it will also be much easier to be with family and friends.</p>

<p>I’m sure this will be a great adventure. Maybe I’ll adopt a cat! 🐈 🐈 🐈</p>
