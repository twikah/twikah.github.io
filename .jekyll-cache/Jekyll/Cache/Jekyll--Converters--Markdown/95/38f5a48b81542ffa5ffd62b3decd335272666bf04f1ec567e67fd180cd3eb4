I"^<p>I’ve been trying to learn web development on my own for a while now.</p>

<p>I’ve done some online tutorials and was able to do some my portfolio and MLS
website but still Rails is a lot of magic and I’m constantly confused and don’t
know how to tackle new features that I want to implement.</p>

<p>I looked around for bootcamps in Lisbon. I found Ironhack, Le Wagon and Academia
de Código. I searched their syllabus, their length and their cost and ended up
choosing Le Wagon.</p>
