I"D<p>If there’s something I wanted while growing up, it was adopting a cat!
My cousin new this and she has a friend with kittens to give away, so she thought of me!</p>

<p>And so in July I became a cat mom 🤩 🥳</p>

<p>Looking on the bright side, I’ll finally have my books around me again 🤓</p>

<p>Of course, it will also be much easier to be with family and friends.</p>

<p>I’m sure this will be a great adventure. Maybe I’ll adopt a cat! 🐈 🐈 🐈</p>
