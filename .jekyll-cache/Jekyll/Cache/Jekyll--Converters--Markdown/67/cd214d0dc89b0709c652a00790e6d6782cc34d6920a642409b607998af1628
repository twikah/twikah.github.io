I"a	<p>Two weeks ago I finished the 9-week web development bootcamp at Le Wagon Lisbon.</p>

<p>What a journey! It’s impressive how much you can learn in 9 weeks. We started
out with programming basics such as data types - <strong>always think of the data
type that an operation will return</strong>!</p>

<p>Then, we approached flow control and more advanced concepts of OOP, like classes
and inheritance.</p>

<p>From there, we learned about databases, schema design and SQL. We touched
front end with a week of HTML, CSS and Javascript ES6 (I loved learning more
about AJAX).</p>

<p>The last part of the program involved Rails and useful tools to help building
robust web apps in teams.</p>

<p>I had a little bit of experience with Rails before the bootcamp. I was able to
put pieces of code together and make it work, but many times I didn’t understand
what the code was doing. These 9 weeks helped have a much clearer picture of
what’s happening there.</p>

<p>Throughout the bootcamp we would buddy up with another students randomly to solve
code challenges. This was really great to sharpen our problem-solving skills,
understand how other people would tackle the chalenges and to create connections
with everybody.</p>

<p>In the final weeks students were grouped in teams of 4 to prototype, develop and
ship 2 web apps. I described these 2 apps in the projects session of my webfolio,
so if you want to know more about them please check the Secret Sessions and
Outflix project pages 😍</p>

<p>After all the intensive coding, sweat and tears, I’m now searching for a junior
developer job in Lisbon. The bootcamp finished just as the Coronavirus became a
real threat in Portugal and people have to be on quarentine.</p>

<p>This is making the task of finding a new job a bit harder. If you know tech
recruiters who work in Lisbon please let me know or tell them about me! I have
my CV on the webfolio’s home page and you can also email me or reach out via
contact form.</p>

<p>In the end, I couldn’t be happier for the amazing community that I met. The team
at Le Wagon Lisbon is incredible and their support made everything easier, so a
big thanks to all of the teachers, assistants and fellow students!</p>
