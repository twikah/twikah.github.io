I"&<p>If there’s something I wanted while growing up, it was adopting a cat!</p>

<p>My cousin new this and she has a friend with kittens to give away, so she thought of me!
And so in July I became a cat mom 🤩 🥳</p>

<p>Meet Poki, the cutest cat on the block.
He is now almost 3 months old.</p>

<p>I’ve never held such a young and cute kitten before and he’s absolutely adorable 😍</p>

<p>The opportunity came about in May, when he was born. It took me some time get my boyfriend on board but he eventually agreed.</p>

<p>Now he just looks at Poki and melts… Just like me 😄</p>

<p>Looking on the bright side, I’ll finally have my books around me again 🤓</p>

<p>Of course, it will also be much easier to be with family and friends.</p>

<p>I’m sure this will be a great adventure. Maybe I’ll adopt a cat! 🐈 🐈 🐈</p>
