I"·<p><a href="https://www.outsystems.com/platform/">OutSystems</a> is a low code platform that
gives IT professionals and developers tools to build, deploy and manage mobile
and web apps in a fast and efficient manner.</p>

<p>All the core development happens on Service Studio, the main OutSystems IDE,
using domain-specific visual language. It provides cool functionalities like
full-stack visual development &amp; single-click deployment. It can be deployed
either on Cloud or on-premise. The system can be integrated with almost all
popular platforms.</p>

<p>I had heard a lot of interesting things about OutSystems in the past and was
curious to try it out.
Last April, I started studying to get a certification to
become an OutSystems Associate Web Developer.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>It was almost a month of doing and redoing the same
<a href="https://www.outsystems.com/learn/paths/2/becoming-a-traditional-web-developer/">guided path</a>
and training the possible questions that might come in the test. Finally, by the
end of April I passed my certification with flying colors! I scored 90% ðŸš€</p>

<p>Then, in May, I embraced this generous initiative from
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/kinetit/">KinetIT</a>
to continue exploring the power of the OutSystems platform. KinetIT launched a
mentorship program where I and a group of tech-savvy people were invited to
complete 2 of the OutSystems official guided paths. To accomplish this, we had
daily meetings to share our progress, ask questions and also weekly sessions on
specific OutSystems topics.</p>

<p>This was a great way for me to keep learning and I am very grateful to KinetIT
for the initiative and want to thank the mentors and my fellow mentees for the
support during these weeks.</p>

<p>Letâ€™s see what opportunities June brings!</p>
