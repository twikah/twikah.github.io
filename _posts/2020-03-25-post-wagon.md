Two weeks ago I finished the 9-week web development bootcamp at Le Wagon Lisbon.

What a journey! It's impressive how much you can learn in 9 weeks. We started
out with programming basics such as data types - <strong>always think of the data
type that an operation will return</strong>!

Then, we approached flow control and more advanced concepts of OOP, like classes
and inheritance.

From there, we learned about databases, schema design and SQL. We touched
front end with a week of HTML, CSS and Javascript ES6. I loved learning more
about AJAX.

The last part of the program involved Rails and useful tools to help building
robust web apps in teams.

I had a little bit of experience with Rails before the bootcamp. I was able to
put pieces of code together and make it work, but many times I didn't understand
what the code was doing. These 9 weeks helped have a much clearer picture of
what's happening there. 👩‍💻

Throughout the bootcamp we would buddy up with other students randomly to solve
code challenges. This was really great to sharpen our problem-solving skills
and also to create connections with everybody.

In the final weeks students were grouped in teams of 4 to prototype, develop and
ship 2 web apps. I described the 2 apps my group and I built in my webfolio, so
if you want to know more please check the
[Secret Sessions](https://vanessaesanto.com/projects/4-secret-sessions) and
[Outflix](https://vanessaesanto.com/projects/5-outflix) project pages.

After all the intensive coding, sweat and tears, I'm now searching for a junior
developer job in Lisbon. 👩‍💻The bootcamp finished just as the Coronavirus became
a real threat in Portugal so everybody is now on quarentine.

This is making the task of finding a new job a bit harder. If you know tech
recruiters who work in Lisbon please let me know or tell them about me! I have
my CV on my [home page](https://vanessaesanto.com) and you can also
email me or reach out via contact form.

In the end, I couldn't be happier for the amazing community that I met. The team
at Le Wagon Lisbon is incredible and their support made everything easier, so a
big thanks to all of the teachers, assistants and fellow students!
