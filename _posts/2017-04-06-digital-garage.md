I discovered [Google's Digital Garage](https://digitalgarage-au.withgoogle.com/) while I was still in Portugal and immediately thought it would be a great opportunity for me to learn Digital Marketing with the best, for free and even get a certificate in the end!

I finally finished it and, of course, took my notes. I wrote them on [Qwilr](qwilr.com), a platform I had just discovered that turns your documents into web pages with very attractive templates.

For now, [here](https://vanessaesanto.qwilr.com/zQK0J4rATMeu) are my notes on Digital Marketing.
