Two years after leaving to travel around the world, we're back to Lisbon.
No, not just visiting. We rented this new apartment with a 2-year contract,
so... Here to stay!

It feels good to be back home but it wasn't what I wanted to do. I wanted to take
advantage of my remote job and keep travelling for one more year. But my partner
in crime wanted to stay and so I stayed.

Looking on the bright side, I'll finally have my books around me again 🤓

Of course, it will also be much easier to be with family and friends.

I'm sure this will be a great adventure. Maybe I'll adopt a cat! 🐈 🐈 🐈
