I've developed my first professional website!

And I've just published a new project page on my website about the whole process.
What an adventure!

To know more about how did I go about please check out the project page
[here](https://vanessaesanto.com/projects/2-mls).

I hope this is just the first of experiences developing a website, it was so
much fun!
