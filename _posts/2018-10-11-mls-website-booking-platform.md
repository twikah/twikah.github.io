After developing MLS website I was asked to take my coding adventure one step
further. I was tasked with creating a booking platform to support the company
business.

What a great responsability!

I took some time to think very carefully of a data model that would suit the
company's needs and automate the procedures that were the most time consuming
for recruiters and for managers.

To know the details please check out the project page
[here](https://vanessaesanto.com/projects/3-booking).

It took me 5 months to get the first version of the booking platform out but I
did it! It's just so awesome when your code works :)
