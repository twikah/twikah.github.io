Here is an excerpt from [this](https://zapier.com/blog/daily-routines/?utm_campaign=The%20Morning%20and%20Evening%20Routines%20That%20Will%20Set%20Up%20Each%20Day%20for%20Success&utm_medium=email&utm_source=blogblogposts) Zapier article. I find it curious that I never took the time to think about the differences between these words.

> *Habits vs. Routines vs. Rituals:* Wondering what the difference is between
habits, routines, and rituals? **Habits** are things that we do automatically –
things like checking your email first thing in the morning or putting your keys
in a specific spot when you get home. **Routines** are usually a collection of
habits or actions you do on a regular basis to bring order to your day–checking
your email, then writing your day's to-do list, then checking your team's project
management tool as a way of getting the day started. **Rituals** are like
routines. The main difference is [the attitude behind the
actions](http://www.theemotionmachine.com/routines-vs-rituals/): taking a walk
everyday at lunch could be considered a routine if you think of it as something
you need to do for your productivity. Or it could be a ritual if you think of it
as a way to break out of the mundane and enjoy nature. While we're focusing on
habits and routines here, most routines could be turned into rituals with a
change of perspective.
